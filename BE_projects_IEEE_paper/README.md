# BE Final-Year Project and Mini Project – Akash J

This folder contains the two engineering projects completed during my Bachelor of Engineering (ECE).  
These projects serve as evidence of my independent technical and research scientific work.

## 🫁 Main Project: Low-Cost IoT-Based Ventilator  
**Type:** Final-Year Major Project  
**Status:** Research paper published  
**Files included:**  
- Low_Cost_Ventilator_IEEE_Paper_.pdf  
- low_cost_ventilator_report_final_project.pdf  

### Description  
This was my primary BE final-year project.  
I designed a low-cost ventilator using airflow and pressure sensors, microcontroller-based control,  
PID regulation, system modeling, and embedded system architecture suitable for emergency medical use.  
The project includes a full engineering report and a published paper in IEEE format.

## 🤖 Mini Project: Fire-Fighting Robot  
**Type:** Semester Mini Project  
**Files included:**  
- Fire_Fighting_Robot_Presentation_.pdf  

### Description  
Developed an autonomous fire-fighting robot capable of detecting flame sources, avoiding obstacles,  
and performing extinguishing actions.  
Implemented using sensor integration, embedded programming, and basic robotics control.

These two projects represent my core engineering work during my bachelor’s degree and demonstrate  
my ability to independently execute technical and research-oriented projects.
